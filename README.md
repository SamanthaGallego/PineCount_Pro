# Project Summary: PineCount Pro - Automated Pineapple Detection and Counting in Agriculture üçç

As the project lead for "PineCount Pro," I spearheaded an innovative endeavor in the field of precision agriculture. Our project focused on automating the detection and counting of pineapples in extensive crop fields, with the aim of enhancing agricultural management and increasing production efficiency. Some notable aspects of my contribution include:

Technologies and Process:

I implemented computer vision as the cornerstone of our solution, enabling the development of a system capable of accurately and efficiently identifying and counting pineapples.
I led the creation of a comprehensive dataset using the Roboflow platform. We captured images of the crop and conducted meticulous labeling, resulting in a high-quality dataset crucial for training our model.
I oversaw the successful implementation of a YOLOv7 neural network, which proved highly effective in real-time detection and counting of pineapples in the field.
Key Achievements:

I supervised model training with training and test data, achieving outstanding accuracy in real-world pineapple detection.
I led an additional proof-of-concept involving the application of our system to real-time video. We extracted each frame from the video and executed detection and counting for each frame, producing an impressive visual representation of the counting process in action.
This project was conducted in collaboration with a three-person team, and my leadership played a pivotal role in the overall project's success. This experience has allowed me to develop strong skills in computer vision, machine learning, and technology project management.
